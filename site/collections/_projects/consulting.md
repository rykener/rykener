## Who is this for?

Consulting services are for people who are not chronically ill, but have a sick person in their life that they want to better learn to care for. This could be a spouse, a child, a parent, a lover, an employee, a friend, or anyone else.

## Not understanding

One of the fundamental barriers to providing sick people with proper care is a lack of understanding as to what their experience is like. This is made even more difficult when a person’s illness is “invisible.” I meet with caregivers to talk about the person they’re caring for and to help them bridge the gap of understanding. Being sick is a lot of work, and sometimes it’s not within the capacity of the sick person to explain themselves to their caretaker. Occasionally I will meet with the two people separately to help me get a better understanding of where the gaps are, and then I will help to fill those in.

## Conflict

Both being sick and caring for a sick person are demanding and stressful positions to be in. Because of this conflict does arise. While I do not provide direct mediation services, I do meet with caregivers who are curious about their own role in conflict, and I help them to see how they can improve. We can additionally work though ways of communicating with sick people to help create the best outcomes during times of conflict.

## Navigating the system

As a caregiver you may be the point person when helping the person in your life navigate the medical, health insurance, or disability insurance system. Especially in the U.S., this is not only taxing work, but it’s also exceptionally difficult. Sometimes it can help to have someone in your corner who can guide you in the right direction when trying to make these systems work. I will work with you to understand how these systems operate (i.e. profit over people) in order to give you the tools you need to navigate them yourself.

## More

These are just a few examples of how we can work together. I have a wide range of experiences and skills that can be passed on to caregivers in a variety of situations.


## Model & Pricing

| **Offering** | **Time**   | **Price** |
|==============|============|===========|
| Intro Call   | 10 minutes | Free      |
| Session      | 50 minutes | $100-$300 |

I use a tier based rate and availability system. Each client that chooses to pay a sponsorship rate ($300-$200) directly allows me to make a slot available for $150 or $100. This means that a certain number of sponsorship slots have to be filled before I can make a sponsored slot available. I ask that potential clients be honest with themselves about what they can comfortably afford so that we can work together to make my services available to lower income folks at less expensive rates. This table shows the current slots and rates available. 

 | **Fee Per Session** | **Slots Available?** |
 |=====================|======================|
 | $300                | Available            |
 | $250                | Available            |
 | $200                | Available            |
 | $150                | Not available        |
 | $100                | Not available        |

**Intro call?** A quick phone call where we can check in about wants, needs, and goals. This is a  brief way to help us determine whether we want to work together. There is no charge for this. This is not a sales call.

**Where are the package deals? The bonus content? The discounts?** I do not offer package deals, bonus content, or discounts. These are marketing tactics that are not appropriate for my practice. I want you to have as many sessions with me as you’d like, without me locking you into some predefined number that says “this is how long it’s going to take”. You can meet with me as much or as little as you want. That being said, understand that noticeable change takes time and perseverance. We will need to meet more than a couple times in order for us to make true progress together. Depending on what we’re working on I like to see clients at least 10 times, however, this is not a rule. It’s all up to you.
