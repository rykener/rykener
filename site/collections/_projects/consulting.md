## Who is this for?

Consulting services are for people who are not chronically ill, but have a sick person in their life that they want to better learn to care for. This could be a spouse, a child, a parent, a lover, an employee, a friend, or anyone else.

## Not understanding

One of the fundamental barriers to providing sick people with proper care is a lack of understanding as to what their experience is like. This is made even more difficult when a person’s illness is “invisible.” I meet with caregivers to talk about the person they’re caring for and to help them bridge the gap of understanding. Being sick is a lot of work, and sometimes it’s not within the capacity of the sick person to explain themselves to their caretaker. Occasionally I will meet with the two people separately to help me get a better understanding of where the gaps are, and then I will help to fill those in.

## Conflict

Both being sick and caring for a sick person are demanding and stressful positions to be in. Because of this conflict does arise. While I do not provide direct mediation services, I do meet with caregivers who are curious about their own role in conflict, and I help them to see how they can improve. We can additionally work though ways of communicating with sick people to help create the best outcomes during times of conflict.

## Navigating the system

As a caregiver you may be the point person when helping the person in your life navigate the medical, health insurance, or disability insurance system. Especially in the U.S., this is not only taxing work, but it’s also exceptionally difficult. Sometimes it can help to have someone in your corner who can guide you in the right direction when trying to make these systems work. I will work with you to understand how these systems operate (i.e. profit over people) in order to give you the tools you need to navigate them yourself.

## More

These are just a few examples of how we can work together. I have a wide range of experiences and skills that can be passed on to caregivers in a variety of situations.
