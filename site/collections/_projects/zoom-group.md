## What's this group about?

This group is for queer and trans people with health issues who are looking for camaraderie, community, or connection around matters of health. It’s also a great way to meet me if you’re considering working with me 1-on-1. The group meets once a month on Zoom for 90 minutes and typically follows the same format each meeting:

* Introductions
* Guided meditation
* Short break
* A talk about a topic relating to being sick
* Group discussion of the topic
* Room for discussion about other topics

Depending on how many people attend we may use breakout groups at various points in the program. 

## Sounds like this could get pretty heavy?

Yeah. I mean, dealing with chronic illness is a heavy thing. This is a space where people can address the difficult parts of being sick. We should expect to occasionally hear some pretty gnarly stuff. And that’s okay. We are strong and we have the capacity to hold space for each other. It’s so much easier to love and grow in the presence of others.

## Why only queer and trans people?

I find that groups need to have more than a single thing in common to be able to quickly ground and find safety. Also, my Instagram audience, which is my major source of clients for this business, is primarily QT. I think for cishet people there are going to be a lot more options for chronic illness support groups, so it’s important to me to create a space that’s just for queers. I accept clients of all identities for my 1-on-1 sessions, so consider taking a look at that offering if you’d like to work together!
