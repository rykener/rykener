## What's this group about?

This group is for queer and trans people with health issues who are looking for camaraderie, community, or connection around matters of health. It’s also a great way to meet me if you’re considering working with me 1-on-1. The group meets once a month on Zoom for 90 minutes and typically follows the same format each meeting:

* Introductions
* Guided meditation
* Open discussion
* A talk about a topic relating to being sick
* Group discussion of the topic
* Room for discussion about other topics

I tend to approach the talk I give as well as the attitudes I take in this group from a distinctly Zen Buddhist lens. You don't have to be Buddhist to attend, though I like to let people know that that's where my philosophy is arrising from. 

Depending on how many people attend we may use breakout groups at various points in the program. 

## Sounds like this could get pretty heavy?

It's actually not. My experience is that as people bring up difficult experiences in their life, that the group itself comes more alive. We see the struggle and humaity in each other and we connect more. 

## Why only queer and trans people?

I find that groups need to have more than a single thing in common to be able to quickly ground and find safety. Also, my Instagram audience, which is my major source of clients for this business, is primarily QT. I think for cishet people there are going to be a lot more options for chronic illness support groups, so it’s important to me to create a space that’s just for queers. I accept clients of all identities for my 1-on-1 sessions, so consider taking a look at that offering if you’d like to work together!
