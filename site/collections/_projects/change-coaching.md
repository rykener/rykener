## What this is

This is a space for you and me to work together on what is typically a predefined problem of yours; or maybe your problem is that you’re not quite sure what your problem is. That’s okay too, we can work to define it together. I provide a non-judgemental, supportive space where you will be completely heard, and where you will have access to my feedback and advice if you want it. I will be by your side to help you integrate and transform your life according to your vision. 

We can work together to create systems of resilience in your life. This can look like building acceptance, social support, or practicing joy. Or resilience can look like anything we want it to. When we start building up our day-to-day resilience we fortify ourselves and switch to a more proactive form of mental health care.

I draw heavily from my 10+ years of training in Zen Buddhism to offer a wide range of mindfulness practices and techniques. Mindfulness is not for everyone, and it is not for every situation, but when carefully applied to the right moment it can have a profound impact on our lives.

We can set goals, define outcomes, and navigate personal growth. One of my jobs is to help you discover, clarify, and align with your goals. I’ll help you discover for yourself what solutions and strategies can help you move forward. One of my goals is for you to  learn how I work so that you can move forward without me, but  I will stick with you as you transition into new ways of living, helping with accountability as you see fit.


## What this isn't

This work, which might be considered “coaching,” is not therapy, and I am not a therapist. I do not diagnose or treat mental illness (though I do work with people who have mental illness). It is my belief that many types of trauma processing should be done with a licensed therapist. While sometimes past traumas may come up in our work, it cannot be our explicit focus. Some clients find that focusing on new attitudes for the present may help them recontextualize the past. We will use the past to help us understand the present, but the past cannot be our focus beyond contextualizing the now. Processing the past is work that should be done with a therapist.


## Model & Pricing

| **Offering** | **Time**   | **Price** |
|==============|============|===========|
| Intro Call   | 10 minutes | Free      |
| Session      | 50 minutes | $50-$200  |

I use a tier based rate and availability system. Each client that chooses to pay a sponsorship rate ($250-$150) directly allows me to make a slot available for $100 or $50. This means that a certain number of sponsorship slots have to be filled before I can make a sponsored slot available. I ask that potential clients be honest with themselves about what they can comfortably afford so that we can work together to make my services available to lower income folks at less expensive rates. This table shows the current slots and rates available. 

 | **Fee Per Session** | **Slots Available?** |
 |=====================|======================|
 | $200                | Available            |
 | $150                | Available            |
 | $100                | Available            |
 | $75                 | Not available
 | $50                 | Not available        |

**Intro call?** A quick phone call where we can check in about wants, needs, and goals. This is a  brief way to help us determine whether we want to work together. There is no charge for this. This is not a sales call.

**Where are the package deals? The bonus content? The discounts?** I do not offer package deals, bonus content, or discounts. These are marketing tactics that are not appropriate for my practice. I want you to have as many sessions with me as you’d like, without me locking you into some predefined number that says “this is how long it’s going to take”. You can meet with me as much or as little as you want. That being said, understand that noticeable change takes time and perseverance. We will need to meet more than a couple times in order for us to make true progress together. Depending on what we’re working on I like to see clients at least 10 times, however, this is not a rule. It’s all up to you.
