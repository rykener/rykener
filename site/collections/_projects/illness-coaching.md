## What this is

During regular meetings we will focus on building management strategies for living with chronic illness or disability, both practically and in the abstract. In a series of video calls, we talk about you and your health. The topics are tailored to your unique needs, but generally will fall into three categories:

### **Practical/External** 

This category often includes specific, tangible goals like navigating the healthcare system, symptom tracking, care plans, and setting boundaries to name a few. Essentially, this is about managing the practical realities of being sick. Being sick is a skill, and like most skills it can be improved with practice and mentorship. 

### **Abstract/Internal**

This category is about the emotional and spiritual realities of being sick, and how to find well-being inside an envelope of illness. Some topics in this category could include the processes of acceptance, grief, healing, and how spiritual practice can fit into your life, among others. In a broken medical system, practical solutions only get us so far.  

I offer to train all my clients in various mindfulness techniques, including meditation. These practices are not for everyone, but those who are interested often find them beneficial.

### **Change Coaching**

Change coaching involves talking through where we are in our lives and where we want to be. With you as the expert on your own life, and with me as a change facilitator, we collaborate to identify ways in which you'd like to grow, and then work together to make it happen. It's a lighthearted collaborative process that, if we take it seriously, can have profound change on our lives.

## Model & Pricing

| **Offering** | **Time**   | **Price** |
|==============|============|===========|
| Intro Call   | 10 minutes | Free      |
| Session      | 50 minutes | $50-$200  |

I use a tier based rate and availability system. Each client that chooses to pay a sponsorship rate ($250-$150) directly allows me to make a slot available for $100 or $50. This means that a certain number of sponsorship slots have to be filled before I can make a sponsored slot available. I ask that potential clients be honest with themselves about what they can comfortably afford so that we can work together to make my services available to lower income folks at less expensive rates. This table shows the current slots and rates available. 

 | **Fee Per Session** | **Slots Available?** |
 |=====================|======================|
 | $200                | Available            |
 | $150                | Available            |
 | $100                | Available            |
 | $75                 | Not available        |
 | $50                 | Not available        |

**Intro call?** A quick phone call where we can check in about wants, needs, and goals. This is a  brief way to help us determine whether we want to work together. There is no charge for this. This is not a sales call.
