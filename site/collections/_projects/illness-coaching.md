## What this is

Sometimes called a "Crip Doula" or a "Mad Crip Doula."

During regular meetings we will focus on building management strategies for living with chronic illness or disability, both practically and in the abstract. In a series of video calls, we talk about you and your health. The topics are tailored to your unique needs, but generally will fall into two categories:

### **Practical/External** 

This category often includes specific, tangible goals like navigating the healthcare system, symptom tracking, care plans, and setting boundaries to name a few. Essentially, this is about managing the practical realities of being sick. Being sick is a skill, and like most skills it can be improved with practice and mentorship. 

### **Abstract/Internal**

This category is about the emotional and spiritual realities of being sick, and how to find well-being inside an envelope of illness. Some topics in this category could include the processes of acceptance, grief, healing, and how spiritual practice can fit into your life, among others. In a broken medical system, practical solutions only get us so far.  

I offer to train all my clients in various mindfulness techniques, including meditation. These practices are not for everyone, but those who are interested often find them beneficial.

**Here are some examples from both categories that could come up in a session:**
* Processing medical gaslighting and harm
* How to self advocate to doctors and medical professionals
* Preparing for doctor appointments
* Power imbalances
* Symptom tracking
* Seeking diagnosis
* Understanding and processing an illness
* Creating systems of care within an illness, including pacing
* Stepping into disability, chronic illness, or mental illness.
* Interpersonal and social issues related to disability 
* Internalized ableism 
* Finding motivation
* Family and generational trauma
* Setting and maintaining boundaries 
* Identity labels
* Altered states
* Acceptance
* Healing (physical, spiritual, emotional)
* Diagnoses
* Sex, love, and intimacy
* Intersection of queerness and disability
* Grief
* Fear
* Neurodivergence 
* Spirituality


## What this isn't

I do not provide medical advice, diagnoses, cures, treatments, or therapy. 


## Model & Pricing

| **Offering** | **Time**   | **Price** |
|==============|============|===========|
| Intro Call   | 10 minutes | Free      |
| Session      | 50 minutes | $50-$250 |

I use a tier based rate and availability system. Each client that chooses to pay a sponsorship rate ($250-$150) directly allows me to make a slot available for $100 or $50. This means that a certain number of sponsorship slots have to be filled before I can make a sponsored slot available. I ask that potential clients be honest with themselves about what they can comfortably afford so that we can work together to make my services available to lower income folks at less expensive rates. This table shows the current slots and rates available. 

 | **Fee Per Session** | **Slots Available?** |
 |=====================|======================|
 | $250                | Available            |
 | $200                | Available            |
 | $150                | Available            |
 | $100                | Not available        |
 | $50                 | Not available        |

**Intro call?** A quick phone call where we can check in about wants, needs, and goals. This is a  brief way to help us determine whether we want to work together. There is no charge for this. This is not a sales call.

**Where are the package deals? The bonus content? The discounts?** I do not offer package deals, bonus content, or discounts. These are marketing tactics that are not appropriate for my practice. I want you to have as many sessions with me as you’d like, without me locking you into some predefined number that says “this is how long it’s going to take”. You can meet with me as much or as little as you want. That being said, understand that noticeable change takes time and perseverance. We will need to meet more than a couple times in order for us to make true progress together. Depending on what we’re working on I like to see clients at least 10 times, however, this is not a rule. It’s all up to you.
