## What this is

This is a space for you and me to work together on what is typically a predefined problem of yours; or maybe your problem is that you’re not quite sure what your problem is. That’s okay too, we can work to define it together. I provide a non-judgemental, supportive space where you will be completely heard, and where you will have access to my feedback and advice if you want it. I will be by your side to help you integrate and transform your life according to your vision. 

We can work together to create systems of resilience in your life. This can look like building acceptance, social support, or practicing joy. Or resilience can look like anything we want it to. When we start building up our day-to-day resilience we fortify ourselves and switch to a more proactive form of mental health care.

I draw heavily from my 10+ years of training in Zen Buddhism to offer a wide range of mindfulness practices and techniques. Mindfulness is not for everyone, and it is not for every situation, but when carefully applied to the right moment it can have a profound impact on our lives.

We can set goals, define outcomes, and navigate personal growth. One of my jobs is to help you discover, clarify, and align with your goals. I’ll help you discover for yourself what solutions and strategies can help you move forward. One of my goals is for you to  learn how I work so that you can move forward without me, but  I will stick with you as you transition into new ways of living, helping with accountability as you see fit.


## What this isn't

I do not provide medical advice, diagnoses, cures, treatments, or therapy. While sometimes past traumas may come up in our work, it cannot be our explicit focus. Some clients find that focusing on new attitudes for the present may help them recontextualize the past. We will use the past to help us understand the present, but the past cannot be our focus beyond contextualizing the now.
