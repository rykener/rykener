      <p>Hi, I'm Eleanor, sometimes known as Lithium. I am a community care worker offering emotional, spiritual, and logistical support to people with or without disabilities. I help clients utilize tools like acceptance, proactive care, and mindfulness practices that can help grow capacity for resilience in a harsh world. Creating a non-judgemental, collaborative environment from which to navigate medical systems and social stigmas associated with chronic illness and disability is essential to developing acceptance, perspective, and healing.</p><br><p>You can read more about me <a href="/about">here</a>.</p>

    content_title: Nice Things People Said
    content_html: >-  
      <p>Here are some nice things people have said about me and my writing over the last year or two.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Eleanor brings a gently profound, humbly evocative presence to the spaces she curates. I have never felt as safe and recognized as I do in the [community] they facilitate and nurture. I am immensely grateful for the ways in which she encourages and accompanies my growth, my spirit, my liberation.
          <ul><li>Ayelet Schrek</li></ul></li>
        <li>I am grateful for the support and friendly ear during what was a very hard couple of weeks for me. I can't tell you how much your compassion and understanding helped me feel less alone.</li>
        <li>Thanks for posting such thought provoking stuff. Your [writing] genuinely helped me figure out that I want to be a social worker.</li>
        <li>The way you express ideas often inspires thought in me and encourages me me to feel more comfortable in myself and more confident in my place within the world</li>
        <li>Your writing has been a huge inspiration to me on my journey towards healing.</li>
        <li>Thank you for being such a beam of good. I've grown to really appreciate your dedication and your perspective on being an older<sup>*</sup> transfem and owning that position as a compassionate member of the trans community to younger transfolk... If I make it to be older, I wanna adopt your compassion</li>
      </ul>
      <sup>*</sup>guys, I'm in my 30s, chill.
