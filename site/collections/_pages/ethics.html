      <p>The core of my ethics are formulated around these three tenants: do no harm, practice good, and actualize good for others. I love this, and also sometimes it's not detailed enough to help others understand where I'm coming from. So here's some details:</p>
      <h2 id="discrimination"><strong>Discrimination:</strong></h2>
      <p>I do not discriminate based on age, race, gender (or lack thereof), ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, national origin or disability.</p>
      <h2 id="process"><strong>Process:</strong></h2>
      <p>As we work together my job is to be at your side, to cheer you on, and to occasionally point something out that you might be missing. One thing I will never do is assign blame to my clients. I will also never compare our stories in unproductive or gratuitous ways. If I feel I have useful information for you I will provide it in an upfront manner and will not gatekeep.</p>
      <h2 id="honesty"><strong>Honesty:</strong></h2>
      <p>The statements I make about my practice, written and verbal, are true and accurate to the best of my ability. I don’t claim ownership of material that’s not mine. I do my best to accurately represent the value of working with me. I aim to keep dealings with money transparent and clear so that all parties feel good about the exchange.</p>
      <h2 id="conflicts"><strong>Conflicts:</strong></h2>
      <p>I attempt to identify conflicts of interest as soon as possible, and take appropriate actions to remedy.</p>
      <h2 id="confidentiality"><strong>Confidentiality:</strong></h2>
      <p>As I am not a therapist there is no legal protection of your information and there is nothing in our relationship that resembles a “privileged” relationship. This being said, I protect your information using modern security practices and I do not disclose information about my clients except under circumstances where I may be required to do so by law or where I am consulting with other industry professionals in order to better serve clients.</p>
      <p>I do not maintain confidentiality if I believe there is a credible threat of violence towards another individual or under circumstances where violent neglect of a vulnerable person is being disclosed. I actively work as a non-carceral crisis responder and <strong><em>I do not report suicide risks to the authorities without consent</em></strong>.</p>
      <h2 id="boundaries"><strong>Boundaries:</strong></h2>
      <p>I maintain professional boundaries with my clients. This includes but is not limited to: no romantic or sexual relationships with clients and no regular contact with clients outside of the container of our work together.</p>
      <h2 id="up-front-agreement"><strong>Up Front Agreement:</strong></h2>
      <p>Before we start working together I ensure that there is a clear, written agreement in place and that all financial arrangements are known and agreed upon.</p>
      <h2 id="termination"><strong>Termination:</strong></h2>
      <p>I respect the right of my clients to terminate our relationship at any time for any reason. This termination will not void outstanding financial obligations.</p>
      <h2 id="well-being"><strong>Well-being:</strong></h2>
      <p>The well-being of my clients as well as my own personal well-being are always at the front of our relationship. If I feel I am unable to properly serve a client for whatever reason I will take immediate action to inform them and will attempt to refer them elsewhere if appropriate.</p>
