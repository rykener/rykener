        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p align="justify">
        Hi. I'm Eleanor (any pronouns), but you might know me as Lithium. I live in San Francisco and write poetry, an advice column, silly satire, and essays that I am compiling into a book.   Showing up in the world with ethics and integrity is extremely important to me. I’m disabled and trans, and I have been practicing Zen Buddhism for most of my adult life.
        <br>
        <br>
        I’ve held a variety of interesting careers including pizza maker, watchmaker, electronics repair technician, chief of operations of a startup, software engineer, nanny, and even a Zen Buddhist monk! I generally see myself as a capable and versatile individual, which you may see reflected in my work history. I like to sit with people one on one or in small groups and have direct, meaningful conversations. I have a compassionate heart and a sharp mind for learning how social and structural systems operate. Showing up for and engaging with people who need help is a vital part of how I live my life. After a terrible and enlightening experience with one of my chronic health conditions I realized that I didn’t want to go back to any of my old careers, but instead wanted to provide community care.

        <h2>My health journey</h2>
        <p align="justify">
          If you’re coming to me to talk about disability or illness you’re going to spend a lot of time telling me about your health. I think it’s only fair that I share some of my history here in return. 
          <br>
          <br>
        I’ve had a variety of health issues since birth, but I didn’t start experiencing chronic pain until I was 12 years old. For the most part, that's been my experience ever since. About 10 years later I was in a vehicle collision that not only turned up the dial on how severe my pain was, but it also left me profoundly fatigued and with a host of other symptoms. For the next 8 years I saw doctor after doctor and I received pointless treatment after pointless treatment. I came to eventually understand for myself that I had ME/CFS but I wasn't able to get traction with the medical system on that for another few years.
        <br>
        <br>
        Then I got covid and my bothersome (and disabling) fatigue started to get significantly worse. I developed POTS, MCAS, and SIBO. One week I was struggling to walk to the end of my block, and the next week I was struggling to walk to my kitchen. I went to the emergency room and they told me I was a picture of perfect health. They sent me home with a packet explaining how to exercise. I spent the next 10 months experiencing what is known as "very severe" ME/CFS. I laid horizontally in bed and lived off Soylent and the grace of others. I needed an electric wheelchair just to navigate my small Bay Area apartment. I rarely saw the sun. I learned a lot about my life, my friends and family, and justice. I learned more than I can ever describe and I would never wish it on anyone. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Finally, I was lucky enough to encounter a series of medical professionals who identified that I have Craniocervical Instability (CCI), essentially learning that my neck is hypermobile. It appeared that for the last decade my spinal cord was being crushed by my spine, and that this was the cause of my ME/CFS. I now work with a specialized chiropractor and other specialists to help keep my upper cervical spine in alignment. I no longer experience the worst parts of ME/CFS though I still have a variety of other health issues that need near constant attention. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I don’t know if my system will ever bounce back from all of the trauma of illness, and I think it’s beautiful to live a full and vibrant life in spite of that. My illnesses are part of me and we co-create this life together. I do not define my life by my health.

        <h2>My training</h2>
        <p align="justify">
        No matter the programs and classes I take, my primary training will always be experiential. I have been through a variety of intense and difficult life circumstances that inform how I show up for other people and how I live my life. This includes periods of unstable (or total lack of) housing, mental illness, disability, and being transgender. Living on the margins is an extreme experience, and for many of us, it never stops. These experiences have taught me empathy, how to connect with others under a variety of circumstances, and  how to navigate various systems, even when the cards are stacked against me. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I am currently training as a mental health and wellness coach in a National Board for Health and Wellness Coaching (NBHWC) certified course. Once this training is complete I will be eligible to sit for the NBHWC certification in early 2025. I also actively work as a crisis responder for a crisis hotline that exclusively serves people with marginalized identites. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I have completed Mental Health First Aid training and I am certified to teach the Right Use of Power program. I have been practicing Zen Buddhism, in all its facets, for over a decade. I am not a Buddhist teacher, but my extensive training in mindfulness and compassion does inform my approach. Early last year, I co-founded a practice group for transgender people interested in meditation practice. We lead weekly in person meetings, which help build community and create connections among people with a contemplative practice in a trans friendly environment. All the work that goes into this has been a great source of training for me as well.
